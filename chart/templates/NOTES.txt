MetaGPU Device Plugin has been deployed.

You can verify DaemonSet is up and running with:
  kubectl get ds {{ include "metagpu.fullname" . }} --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}

You are now ready to request MetaGPUs specifying requests for the following resource names:
{{- range .Values.config.deviceSharing }}
  - {{ .resourceName }}
{{- end }}
